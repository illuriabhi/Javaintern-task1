# Java Console Calculator 🧮

This is a simple Java-based calculator application built for the **Elevate Labs Java Developer Internship** task. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using Java Console I/O.

## 💡 Objective
Build a functional command-line calculator to demonstrate understanding of:
- Java syntax
- Console I/O with `Scanner`
- Methods and control flow
- Loops and conditional statements

## 🚀 Features
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- User-friendly text menu
- Continuous operation using a loop until exit
- Handles divide-by-zero gracefully

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 8 or above)
- VS Code / IntelliJ CE
- Command Prompt / Terminal


## 📝 How to Run
1. Compile the code:

2. Run the program:

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Method Overloading (Q1 from Interview)
- `Scanner` for input (Q5)
- Looping structures and conditionals (Q6, Q7)
- Defensive coding (handling divide-by-zero)
- `==` vs `.equals()` (Q3)
